<h1>Chukwunonso - Forex Trading Algorithm

  <h2>Description</h2>
 This project is a dream come true for me. Five years ago, I stepped into the world of trading financial markets with a strong interest in foreign exchange. I've always been someone who dreams big, which is why I pursued a master's in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.
 Towards the middle of my journey, I realized that most traders fail not because they have a bad trading strategy, but due to emotions, lack of consistency, lack of trust in their strategy, and an overall disbelief in the compounding effect of money. To me, algorithmic trading eliminates most of these problems, as the process becomes automatedâ€”allowing traders to focus on trusting their strategy and building the right code.
 I built this algorithm based on the very first strategy I used almost five years ago, and I will continue to develop more as I revisit my trading journey.
 I hope you enjoy this one!

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b> (21H2)

- <h2>Project Opener:</h2>
This trading bot focuses on The Great British Pound vs The United States Dollar. The same algorithm can be applied on any other forex pair, you just need to change the symbol in the configuration. I used one of my earlier trading strategies applying proper risk management at a 1:2 Risk to Reward for every 1% of the account balance invested into each trade. It's usually advisable to be more conservative risking less than 1% per trade, but for the purpose of the project and that it is a demo account, I kept each trade at 1% risk. Also, these visualizations are outputs from my trading strategy's algorithm which wasnt shared for privacy reasons, but in the trading bot's pine script, the strategy is broken down and stored in df = detect_support_resistance(df, window=10), df = detect_breakout_retest(df) and df = detect_trade_signals(df). 
Multiple conditions were placed in the pine script to guide the bot when looking for trading setups, while executing a trade and while managing a trade. Thank you!

<h2>Testing my Trading Bot:</h2>
I had to put the bot in a while loop to continuously scan the market every 5 minutes for trading opportunities, I changed this later on to scan every 10 seconds to prevent missing trading opportunities and keep my results consistent.
