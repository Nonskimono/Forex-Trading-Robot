<h1>Chukwunonso - Forex Trading Algorithm

  <h2>Description</h2>
 This project is a dream come true for me. Five years ago, I stepped into the world of trading financial markets with a strong interest in foreign exchange. I've always been someone who dreams big, which is why I pursued a master's in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.
 Towards the middle of my journey, I realized that most traders fail not because they have a bad trading strategy, but due to emotions, lack of consistency, lack of trust in their strategy, and an overall disbelief in the compounding effect of money. To me, algorithmic trading eliminates most of these problems, as the process becomes automatedâ€”allowing traders to focus on trusting their strategy and building the right code.
 I built this algorithm based on the very first strategy I used almost five years ago, and I will continue to develop more as I revisit my trading journey.
 I hope you enjoy this one!
